# BruteForceDB_Search
Rust applet that recursively searches strings against BruteForceDB found here: https://github.com/duyet/bruteforce-database

Go to that link and download the package and dump all the .txt files into a directory

Then pass the password you want to search and it will tell you if it is in the database or not.

If its in there, best not to use it.

In general though, you should always favor modern randomized strings over passwords, and keys over strings.
